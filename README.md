# Federated Learning Workshop AMLD2021


## 1. Interactive Examples: torch Federated Learning
### 1.1 Simulating Federated Learning using torch

This example introduces basic components that are part of the Federated Learningi workflow.
In the simulation we:
1. Train a baseline model on the CIFAR10 dataset.
2. Simulate a server and client and send a model from server to client to be trained.
3. Simulate a server and multiple clients and train a global model on multiple clients and perform FedAvg.
